In this project, we will be building out a web application to search for news articles, display
them, and have the ability to bookmark articles for reading later. We will be working on both a
client and server component, learning to use third-party APIs like [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/),
front-end libraries like [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/), as well as continuing to practice with
the MVC design pattern and advanced DOM manipulation.

## Learning Goals

These are specific topics covered in this project:

- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Building a REST API (with Node + Express)
- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)
- Asynchronous programming: `fetch`, `async`/`await` (ES8)
- Environment variables
